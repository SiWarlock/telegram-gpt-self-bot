# Telegram & Discord Self-Bot

A powerful self-bot with GPT integration, self-destructing messages, chat summarization features, and role-based access control. Can be used with Telegram, Discord, or both simultaneously.

## Features

### Flexible Setup
- Use with Telegram only
- Use with Discord only
- Or use both simultaneously
- Bot automatically detects available credentials and starts appropriate services

### Self-Bot vs Companion Bot

#### Discord
1. **Self-Bot Mode** (Using User Token):
   - Uses your personal Discord account
   - Can access all your chats and servers
   - Can read message history
   - Can use custom emojis from your servers
   - More natural interaction as it appears as you
   - Note: Against Discord's Terms of Service

2. **Companion Bot Mode** (Using Bot Token):
   - Separate bot account with [BOT] tag
   - Must be invited to servers
   - Limited to servers where it's been added
   - Cannot access message history before joining
   - Cannot use custom emojis unless added to source server
   - More official but limited functionality

#### Telegram
1. **Self-Bot Mode** (Using User Session):
   - Uses your personal Telegram account
   - Full access to all your chats
   - Can read entire message history
   - Can join private groups
   - Can use any sticker or emoji
   - Appears as normal user activity

2. **Companion Bot Mode** (Using Bot Token):
   - Separate bot account with bot badge
   - Must be added to groups
   - Cannot see messages between users
   - Cannot join channels/groups on its own
   - Limited to bot API capabilities
   - More restrictive but officially supported

Choose the mode that best fits your needs and compliance requirements. This implementation supports both modes for maximum flexibility.

DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_url
```

### Required for Telegram (Optional)
```env
API_ID=your_telegram_api_id

## Service Selection

The bot will automatically:

2. Start Discord service if Discord token is provided
3. Start both services if all credentials are available
4. Exit with an error if no valid credentials are found

## Getting Credentials

### Telegram Credentials
1. Get API_ID and API_HASH:
   - Visit https://my.telegram.org
   - Log in with your phone number
   - Go to 'API Development Tools'
   - Create a new application
   - Copy API_ID and API_HASH

2. Get SESSION_STRING:
   - Add your API_ID and API_HASH to .env file
   - Run the session generator:
     ```bash
     npm run get-session
     ```
   - Enter your phone number when prompted
   - Enter the verification code you receive
   - Enter your 2FA password if enabled
   - Copy the generated session string to your .env file
   - Note: You only need to do this once, the session string remains valid until you log out

3. Get your Telegram User ID:
   - Message @userinfobot on Telegram
   - Copy your ID to TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID in .env

4. Final .env setup for Telegram:
   ```env
   API_ID=your_api_id
   API_HASH=your_api_hash
   SESSION_STRING=your_generated_session_string
   TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID=your_telegram_user_id
   ```

### Discord Token and ID
1. Get your Discord token:
   - Open Discord in browser
   - Press F12 for Developer Tools
   - In the network tab, find a request to the Discord API https://discord.com/api/
   - Look for the Authorization header in the request headers

   - Right-click your name and select "Copy ID"
   - Add to DISCORD_OWNER_ID in .env

## Security Notes

- Follow platform terms of service
- Be careful with self-destructing messages in important chats
- If your Discord token is exposed, change your password immediately
- Regularly review user permissions and roles
